    "Large language models (LLMs) typically come with a pre-defined context window size. For example, inputs to LLaMA models (Touvron et al., 2023) must be fewer than 2048 tokens. This pre-set\n",
    "context window limit is frequently exceeded in applications such as conducting long conversations,\n",
    "summarizing long documents, or executing long-term planning. For these applications, LLMs with\n",
    "longer context windows are preferred. However, training an LLM from scratch with long context\n",
    "windows requires significant investments. This naturally leads to a question: Can we extend the\n",
    "context window of an existing pre-trained LLM?\n",
    "One straightforward approach is to fine-tune an existing pre-trained Transformer with a longer context window. However, empirically, we found that models trained this way adapt to long context\n",
    "windows very slowly. After training for more than 10000 batches, the effective context window\n",
    "saw a minimal increase, moving from 2048 to 2560 (Table 4). This suggests that such method is\n",
    "inefficient for extending to substantially longer context windows.\n",
    "While certain techniques such as ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) and LeX (Sun et al., 2022) enable length\n",
    "extrapolation of Transformers, i.e. train on short context windows and inference on longer ones,\n",
    "many existing pre-trained LLMs, including LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), use positional encodings\n",
    "that have weak extrapolation properties (e.g., RoPE (Su et al., 2021)). Therefore, the applicability\n",
    "of these techniques for extending the context window sizes of such LLMs remains limited.\n",
    "In this work, we introduce Position Interpolation to enable context window extensions for certain\n",
    "existing pre-trained LLMs, including LLaMA. The key idea is, instead of extrapolation, we directly\n",
    "down-scale the position indices so that the maximum position index matches the previous context\n",
    "window limit in the pre-training stage. See Figure 1 for an illustration. In other words, to accommodate more input tokens, we interpolate the position encodings at neighboring integer positions,\n",
    "utilizing the fact that position encodings can be applied on non-integer positions, as opposed to\n",
    "extrapolating outside the trained positions, which may lead to catastrophic values. We verify our\n",
    "approach theoretically, by showing that the interpolated attention score has a much smaller upper\n",
    "bound (∼ 600× smaller in LLaMA 7B setting) than the extrapolated one, and is thus much more\n",
    "stable. Therefore, interpolated position encodings are easier for the model to adapt.\n",
    "Empirically, we found that Position Interpolation is highly effective and efficient, requiring only a\n",
    "very short period of fine-tuning for the model to fully adapt to greatly extended context windows.\n",
    "We present experimental results for extending the context window to up to 32768 from the initial\n",
    "2048 across 7B to 65B LLaMA models using Position Interpolation. Our results show that\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Position Interpolation can easily enable very long context windows (e.g. 32768), requiring\n",
    "only fine-tuning for 1000 steps on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020) to achieve a good quality.\n",
    "The cost of fine-tuning is negligible compared to the pre-training costs. This confirms\n",
    "our hypothesis that it is relatively easy for the models to adapt to interpolated position\n",
    "encodings.\n",
    "2. Position Interpolation generates strong models that can effectively make use of much extended context window. We show that models extended by Position Interpolation enjoy\n",
    "significant perplexity gains from greatly extended context windows for text modeling, and\n",
    "we show that the perplexity reduces graceful with the enlargement of context windows.\n",
    "We also applied Position Interpolation in a long text summarization task, and demonstrate\n",
    "competitive performances.\n",
    "3. Position Interpolation preserves model quality relatively well for tasks within its original\n",
    "context window sizes. We present a variety of evaluation results for the extended LLaMA\n",
    "models on the original LLaMA benchmark. Compared with original LLaMA models, the\n",
    "extended LLaMA models saw a minor degradation on several standard benchmarks within\n",
    "a 2048 token limit.\n",
    "Our results highlight the innate ability of Transformer models to “extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training” as hypothesized in the seminal work of Vaswani et al. (2017). We reaffirm this hypothesis and suggest that the previously known weakness of extrapolating to longer sequences for language modeling (Press et al., 2022) may be due to direct extrapolation of positional encodings and it can be largely mitigated by interpolating position encodings instead.\n",
    "Concurrent work. Right before our release, we are informed with a concurrent blogpost (SuperHOT kaiokendev (2023)) that also interpolates positional encoding in RoPE to extend the context window from 2K to 8K. Recently, open source community picks it up in Reddit post 1\n",
    "and Github Issues 2, which shows that fine-tuning with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) also seems to work well. Our paper shows a full fine-tuning with up to 65B model work well with Position Interpolation, and we also give theoretical explanations why interpolation achieves much more stable results than extrapolation, by showing that the upper bound of interplated attention score is much lower than that of extrapolated ones\n",

    "Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "LLaMA-2-7B-32K is an open-source, long context language model developed by Together, fine-tuned from Meta's original Llama-2 7B model. This model represents our efforts to contribute to the rapid progress of the open-source ecosystem for large language models. The model has been extended to a context length of 32K with position interpolation, allowing applications on multi-document QA, long text summarization, etc.\n",
    "What's new?\n",
    "\n",
    "This model introduces several improvements and new features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extended Context: The model has been trained to handle context lengths up to 32K, which is a significant improvement over the previous versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pre-training and Instruction Tuning: We have shared our data recipe, which consists of a mixture of pre-training and instruction tuning data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Fine-tuning Examples: We provide examples of how to fine-tune the model for specific applications, including book summarization and long context question and answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Software Support: We have updated both the inference and training stack to allow efficient inference and fine-tuning for 32K context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The model follows the architecture of Llama-2-7B and extends it to handle a longer context. It leverages the recently released FlashAttention-2 and a range of other optimizations to improve the speed and efficiency of inference and training.\n",
    "Training and Fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has been trained using a mixture of pre-training and instruction tuning data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the first training phase of continued pre-training, our data mixture contains 25% RedPajama Book, 25% RedPajama ArXiv (including abstracts), 25% other data from RedPajama, and 25% from the UL2 Oscar Data, which is a part of OIG (Open-Instruction-Generalist), asking the model to fill in missing chunks, or complete the text. To enhance the long-context ability, we exclude data shorter than 2K word. The inclusion of UL2 Oscar Data is effective in compelling the model to read and utilize long-range context.\n",
    "    We then fine-tune the model to focus on its few shot capacity under long context, including 20% Natural Instructions (NI), 20% Public Pool of Prompts (P3), 20% the Pile. We decontaminated all data against HELM core scenarios . We teach the model to leverage the in-context examples by packing examples into one 32K-token sequence. To maintain the knowledge learned from the first piece of data, we incorporate 20% RedPajama-Data Book and 20% RedPajama-Data ArXiv.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we provide examples of how to fine-tune the model for specific applications. The example datasets are placed in togethercomputer/Long-Data-Collections You can use the OpenChatKit to fine-tune your own 32K model over LLaMA-2-7B-32K. Please refer to OpenChatKit for step-by-step illustrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Long Context QA.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We take as an example the multi-document question answering task from the paper “Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts”. The input for the model consists of (i) a question that requires an answer and (ii) k documents, which are passages extracted from Wikipedia. Notably, only one of these documents contains the answer to the question, while the remaining k − 1 documents, termed as \"distractor\" documents, do not. To successfully perform this task, the model must identify and utilize the document containing the answer from its input context.\n",
    "\n",
    "    With OCK, simply run the following command to fine-tune:\n",
    "\n",
    "    bash training/finetune_llama-2-7b-32k-mqa.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is BookSum, a unique dataset designed to address the challenges of long-form narrative summarization. This dataset features source documents from the literature domain, including novels, plays, and stories, and offers human-written, highly abstractive summaries. We here focus on chapter-level data. BookSum poses a unique set of challenges, necessitating that the model comprehensively read through each chapter.\n",

    "With OCK, simply run the following command to fine-tune:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash training/finetune_llama-2-7b-32k-booksum.sh\n",

    "Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the Together API to try out LLaMA-2-7B-32K for inference. The updated inference stack allows for efficient inference.\n",
